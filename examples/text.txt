Hello Mrs Dupont,
I hope you're well. I'm writing to ask if it would be possible for me to work 
from home tomorrow. I'm having some transport problems at the moment, and I'm worried 
that this might affect my punctuality at the office. 
What's more, I have all the equipment I need at home to complete my tasks efficiently.
I can assure you that I will remain contactable throughout the day and will meet
all deadlines and scheduled meetings. If you have any particular 
preferences or requirements for my work tomorrow, please let me know and I will organise accordingly.
